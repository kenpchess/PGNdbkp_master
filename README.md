## Overview

[PGNdbkp][https://github.com/kenpchess/PGNdbkp_master] is a free for personal use
SAN-UCI chess PGN viewer and SQLite chess database.

PGNdbkp  includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the
chessboard and makes it easy to view or replay moves. This program is considered
somewhat didatic in that it demonstrates several features of PureBasic 6.21,
including event loops, threads, various gadgets, SQLite interface to PureBasic
6.21, auto-resizing of gadgets and other PureBasic 6.21 features. This application
is not completely loaded with sophisticated code but does showcase many nice
features of PureBasic 6.21 including enumeration, postevents, binary data
encapsulation, conditional compilation, RunProgram for launching external 
binaries, and several others. Refer also to the source code as it is quite 
liberally commented.

The main Features of PGNdbkp are :

  * Reads most SAN or UCI PGN gamefiles. It attempts to remove all comments
    and variations, although not 100% perfect. I would suggest using the
    excellent pgn-extract utility (https://github.com/kentdjb/pgn-extract/
    or https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/) to fully
    clean any PGN files you find troublesome. (A command such as:
    pgn-extract -C -V input.pgn --output cleaned.pgn should work fine).
    
  * PGNdbkp also reads and writes an SQLite database file of its' own 
    simple format.
    
  * Allows game export (all games or current game) to SQLite database file.
  
  * Allows current game to be exported to a single-game PGN gamefile textfile.
  
  * Stockfish or UCI engine interaction. Allows chess engine to analyze moves
    or positions. The default engine location is updatable.
    
  * Play a game directly against Stockfish or another UCI engine.
  
  * PLayer search/sort options to sort all games or search for the
    games of a specific player.
    
  * Basic FEN position GUI chessboard editor. Utilizes point-and-click
    GUI to edit games or setup positions.
    
  * Board size option for small or medium-size chessboard.
  
  * GUI allows main window resizing (limited) and allows using arrow-keys
    for move traversal.
